The front-end operations team is the first place that the customer will see when they walk through the door. If the customer sees an open, calm, cool environment when they walk through the door, they will want to shop at our totally amazing company. If the customer sees a cluttered madhouse they will want to run and hide; they will not want to shop! We do not want to make the customer run and hide. In addition to an open, calm, cool and collected environment, we want our customer to see matching open, calm, cool and collected associates approach them with a warm greeting when they walk through the door! It is your job to get the front-end operations team ready to exude calm and cool. A warm greeting goes a long way to show our customers what a totally amazing company feels like. Do you know what an amazing company feels like? It feels like home, but better because our front-end operations team is there to serve!"
